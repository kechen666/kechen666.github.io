          <h4>About Me</h4>
          <p>Hello everyone! I am a first-year graduate student at the University of Science and Technology of China, having graduated from the Artificial Intelligence Experimental Class at Nanchang University. During my studies, I developed a strong interest in quantum computing, which I believe has immense potential. I hope to contribute to the development of universal fault-tolerant quantum computers through in-depth research in this field.</p>
          <p>Previously, I studied the foundational knowledge of quantum computing, algorithms, compilers, simulators, and the related topics of noise and error correction. Currently, I am focusing on quantum error correction research.</p>
          <p>As an undergraduate in Computer Science, I have built a solid knowledge foundation and gained extensive experience in classical computing tools. Initially, I focused on the application of classical computers in quantum computing. However, as my research deepened, I realized the importance of building quantum computer architectures. Therefore, I shifted my focus to quantum error correction, aiming to make breakthroughs in fault-tolerant quantum systems. Currently, I am focusing on the following research directions:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><span class="highlight">Systematic Methods for Building Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computing Architectures</span>: In classical computing systems, layered and decoupled architecture designs have significantly improved system performance and scalability. Inspired by this, I aim to explore how to apply layered decoupling strategies in quantum computers to optimize qubit organization and manipulation, thereby enhancing the stability, fault tolerance, and computational efficiency of quantum computing systems. Achieving this goal will require a long journey.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Optimization Design of Quantum Error Correction Codes and Decoders</span>: Quantum error correction technology is still in rapid development, especially facing numerous technical bottlenecks in quantum storage tasks. Therefore, I closely follow the theoretical and methodological innovations in the construction of quantum error correction codes, as well as the efficient design and implementation of decoders. My goal is to significantly improve the storage fidelity and error correction capabilities of quantum information by optimizing the performance of error correction codes and decoders, providing a solid foundation for the reliable operation of quantum computing.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Accurate Modeling and Parameter Learning of Quantum Noise</span>: The process of quantum error correction inevitably involves the precise characterization and effective handling of complex quantum noise environments. Therefore, I delve into the mathematical models of quantum noise, accurately estimate noise parameters, and explore noise suppression and error correction strategies based on these models. This is crucial for improving the practical performance of quantum computing systems and is one of the key areas I hope to research in the future.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>In terms of research tools, I have a deep understanding and practical experience with classical greedy algorithms, heuristic algorithms, and artificial intelligence technologies. I also have preliminary exposure to tensor networks, a new emerging tool. Additionally, I have accumulated rich project experience and practical skills in programming practice and parallel computing, which will provide strong technical support and methodological reference for my research in quantum computing.</p>
          <p>Apart from academic research, I am passionate about badminton. Although I have not participated in formal competitions, this sport helps me maintain a good physical and mental state during intense research periods.</p>
          <p>I sincerely hope to connect with more outstanding researchers and like-minded peers here, to explore cutting-edge academic issues together, and share research ideas and experiences. Through in-depth communication and collaboration, I believe I can not only enhance my communication and expression skills but also gain inspiration from the collision of ideas, discovering new research perspectives and methodological paths.</p>
